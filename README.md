#. MacGammon - FIBS Client for MacOS

MacGammon is an attempt to revive the now-abandoned CocoaFIBS open source project originally authored by Adam Gerson. For users of more recent versions of MacOS, 
the only viable option has been JavaFIBS, which is not open source, and seems to have suffered from lack of development for many years. 

## Initial Goals

The initial goals of the project are to resurrect the last updated version of the CocoaFIBS source code, get it running on more recent versions of MacOS, and 
eliminating any "blocker" issues. Issues are considered blockers if they cause the application to crash, cause or enable backgammon rules violations, or otherwise
inhibit gameplay.
